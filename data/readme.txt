Non-/Rhetorical Questions Dataset
(The questions have been extracted from Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus: see http://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97/ for details)


FORMAT
{0,1},utterance_i {%,&} utterance_i+1 {%,&}-1 utterance_i-1 {%,&}-2 utterance_i-2

FORMAT-DETAILS
0: non-rhetorical
1: rhetorical

&, &-1, &-2 : The given utterance is spoken by the same person who spoke the main utterance.
%, %-1, %-2 : otherwise.

t_con: connective
t_laugh: laugh
t_empty: no utterance (e.g. "% t_empty" means no utterance follows the main utterance.)

EXAMPLE
X: is that right?
Y: uh-huh
X: well,  do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things?
Y: no,

Suppose the third utterance is the main(or target) utterance and is non-rhetorical.
This is encoded in the dataset as:
0, well,  do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things? % no, %-1 uh-huh  &-2 is that right?
